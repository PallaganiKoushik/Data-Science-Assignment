Optimal Number of Clusters:
The algorithm determined that the best number of clusters for the data is 4, based on the 
Davies-Bouldin (DB) Index.

Davies-Bouldin Index:
Value: 1.106
This metric measures the quality of clustering, where lower values indicate better-defined clusters. 
A value close to 1 suggests reasonably good cluster separation.

Silhouette Score:

Value: 0.275
This measures how similar data points are to their assigned clusters compared to other clusters. 
While 0.275 isn't very high, it suggests some cluster overlap, which can happen in complex data.
